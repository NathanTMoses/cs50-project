# CS50 Final Project
My CS50 2019 Project. This was CS50.

I call it Synergo.
## What?
Synergo is a useful website with 3 main services:

### MailMonkey
Need to send something, fast? Use MailMonkey!
### TextPad
Need to edit a paper? Textpad! C&P something quickly? Textpad!
### Lister
Do things faster, smarter and more organized with Lister.

## Why?
I created this for the CS50 final project

## How?
I used Flask and SQLite for the backend. And HTML,CSS,Bootstrap and a touch of JS for the frontend.
